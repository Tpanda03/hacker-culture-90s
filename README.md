<h1>Introduction</h1>

<div class="section">
<p>
Early hacking in the pre-web era was less about crime and more about curiosity. 
Rooted in 1970s phone-phreaking and the experimental culture of early home computers, 
hacking originally meant exploring systems, tinkering with hardware and software, 
and understanding how things worked beneath the surface. These early communities 
valued learning, creativity, and the free exchange of information long before the 
Internet became a commercial space.
</p>

<p>
As the web exploded in the 1990s, the meaning of “hacker” shifted dramatically. 
While real hackers built communities around openness and shared knowledge, the 
public encountered hacking mainly through media portrayals—many of them exaggerated, 
sensationalized, or misleading. This project focuses not on a chronological history, 
but on how hacking was interpreted, misinterpreted, and transformed in the public 
imagination. By contrasting authentic hacker ethics with their media caricatures, 
we can better understand how the early web was shaped by both cultural fascination 
and technological fear.

<h1>Media Panic in the 1990s</h1>


<!-- A. Pop Culture Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>A. Pop-Culture Hackers as “Cool Outlaws”</h2>

<p>
In the 1990s, mainstream films played a major role in shaping how the public imagined hackers.
Much of the general population had never used the Internet, and movies became their first exposure to 
digital culture. <em>Hackers</em> (1995) presented hacking as a vibrant, rebellious subculture—fast-paced, neon-lit, 
and creatively chaotic. The film framed hackers as anti-authoritarian heroes who used their technical 
skills to expose corruption and challenge powerful institutions (Softley 1995).
</p>

</figure>

<p>
By contrast, <em>The Net</em> (1995) portrayed hacking as a terrifying threat to personal identity and digital 
safety. Sandra Bullock’s character has her entire life erased through database manipulation, suggesting 
that hackers had nearly limitless power over modern systems (Winkler 1995). These contradictory 
depictions contributed to a cultural understanding of hackers as both fascinating and dangerous.

<!-- B. NEWS MEDIA -->
<div class="section">
<h2>B. News Media Creating Fear & Uncertainty</h2>

<p>
If Hollywood provided the fantasy, news media provided the fear. Charles Platt’s “Hackers: Threat or 
Menace?” in <em>WIRED</em> (1994) captured the era’s anxiety, portraying hackers as unpredictable forces capable 
of breaching major institutions. Mainstream newspapers went even further, publishing dramatic 
headlines about teenagers “breaking into NASA” or infiltrating government systems.
</p>

    <figcaption>WIRED Magazine’s “Hackers: Threat or Menace?” (Platt, 1994).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Because most Americans had little understanding of how computers worked, these stories reinforced 
the notion that the Internet was unsafe and filled with invisible threats. Rather than showing hacking 
as technical learning or experimentation, news outlets emphasized danger, vulnerability, and 
criminality.
</p>
</div>


<!-- C. WHY IT MATTERED -->
<div class="section">
<h2>C. Why Media Panic Mattered</h2>

<p>
This wave of media panic had long-lasting consequences. It influenced early cybersecurity legislation, 
leading lawmakers to conflate exploratory hacking with criminal activity. It shaped public fear of 
digital spaces at a time when the Internet was just entering everyday life, framing the web as a place 
where danger was omnipresent. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, the stereotypes created during the 1990s—such as the “hoodie-wearing hacker”—still persist 
today, shaping how the media represents cybercrime and digital security.
